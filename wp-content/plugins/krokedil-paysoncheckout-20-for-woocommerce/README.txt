PaysonCheckout 2.0 for WooCommerce is a plugin that extends WooCommerce, allowing you to take payments via Payson.


== DESCRIPTION ==
<ul>
	<li>All payment methods with one contract</li>
	<li>No fixed fees, get started within 24 hours</li>
	<li>The customer never leaves your e-commerce store</li>
</ul>

In PaysonCheckout 2.0 Payson has removed all unnecessary steps in the checkout to increase conversions and sales. The payment window is nicely integrated into your e-store where customers can pay with a single click! All purchases are based on the service Invoice via email. The customer can then choose to get the goods delivered first and pay retrospectively or pay the invoice immediately upon purchase, for example by card, online bank payment or SMS.

To get started with Payson you need to [sign up](https://www.payson.se/sv/) for a Business account.

More information on how to get started can be found in the [plugin documentation](http://docs.krokedil.com/se/documentation/paysoncheckout-2-0-woocommerce/).
